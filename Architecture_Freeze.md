## 1. Architecture version

**1.0.0** — the first frozen architecture of L.I.O.N.E.L.

Semantic meaning for this project:

| Component | Change requires |
|---|---|
| **MAJOR** | A superseding ADR that changes a decision already in force |
| **MINOR** | A new ADR that adds a decision without contradicting an existing one |
| **PATCH** | An erratum correcting text to state a decision already in force |

---

## 2. Architecture checksum

Deterministic SHA-256 over the architecture-defining set — sorted paths, path bytes plus
file bytes, grouped, then the group digests concatenated and hashed.

```
ARCHITECTURE CHECKSUM
sha256:fab0610aa3167a2f26b0e812dbfe9563abbf7aa28ab18b9d773d945a5a84f233

  ADRs         28 files   sha256:595055620fed54d8baebc3931c060186…
  contracts    31 files   sha256:222451c587f1c1ca1f2c29d1c908e989…
  policy        8 files   sha256:b6d4fd05923eb16b324fe0a29a2041e7…
  artifacts     1 file    sha256:30fb895846a50b7da3e783a63504aa74…
  plan          1 file    sha256:79102470bfdc78dae412b6630c69c8dd…

  69 files hashed
```

**Verified against a clean clone on 2026-08-10.** Reproduce it with:

```bash
python3 scripts/architecture_checksum.py --verify sha256:fab0610aa3167a2f26b0e812dbfe9563abbf7aa28ab18b9d773d945a5a84f233
```

The algorithm is: files partitioned into the five groups below; within a group, sorted by
POSIX-relative path; group digest = `sha256` over the concatenation of (path bytes ‖ file
bytes) with no separator; architecture checksum = `sha256` over the five **raw** group
digests concatenated in the order listed. `scripts/architecture_checksum.py` implements it
and reproduces every group digest above.

**Line endings are part of the checksum.** `.gitattributes` must pin every extension in the
set to `eol=lf` or the same commit yields two different checksums on two machines. This was
not merely theoretical: `*.proto` was unpinned, so a Windows clone checked the three proto
files out as CRLF and computed `222451c5…` → `0a3b44bc…` for the contracts group. Fixed in
`b2e0b94`.

## 3. Frozen scope

The following are **frozen** at version 1.0.0. Changing any of them requires an ADR under §5.

| Element | Frozen state |
|---|---|
| **Architecture decisions** | 28 ADRs, 0001–0028 |
| **Contracts** | Contract set 1.1.0 — 27 JSON Schemas + 3 protobuf, 5 planes |
| **Capability registry** | 5 capabilities, each declaring `requires_network`, `offline_allowed`, `owner`, `phase`, `trust_level` |
| **Artifact lock** | 13 artifacts, all RESOLVED, tiers A=8 B=2 C=2 D=1 |
| **Tier model** | L0–L3 per ADR-0007; L0 conformance is a blocking gate |
| **Trust model** | 4 levels, monotonically non-increasing within a turn (ADR-0012) |
| **Plane separation** | MCP = control, gRPC = data; no PCM on the control plane (ADR-0006) |
| **Policy** | `ci/policy/policy.yaml` — 16 sections |
| **CI gates** | 17 gates, **127 rules**, 20 workflow jobs |
| **Phase plan** | MASTER_PLAN_v2 — 11 gated phases, G0–G10 |

---

## 4. Allowed future changes

Permitted **without** an ADR:

1. **Implementation** under `src/lionel/` conforming to frozen contracts.
2. **Tests** under `tests/` and `evals/`.
3. **Gate implementation work** that enforces an existing decision more completely —
   extending `ci/self_test.sh`, adding coverage. **Adding a new rule that changes what is
   permitted requires an ADR.**
4. **Regenerating generated documents** — `CI_Inventory.md`, `Policy_Gates.md`,
   `Contract_Inventory.md`.
5. **Errata** — correcting text to state a decision already in force, recorded as a dated
   Erratum quoting the original verbatim (precedent: ADR-0013, 2026-08-02).
6. **Artifact version bumps** within an existing artifact, following ADR-0013 pinning rules
   and ADR-0021 evaluation gates.

Requiring an ADR:

1. Any new subsystem, technology, or dependency.
2. Any change to a contract's `stable` surface.
3. Any change to the tier model, trust model, or plane separation.
4. Any new capability, or a change to an existing capability's governance fields.
5. Any relaxation of a gate, exclusion, or policy threshold.
6. Any change to the phase plan or gate criteria.

---

## 5. Change control policy

**Every architectural change follows ADR-0016.**

| Step | Requirement |
|---|---|
| 1 | Search existing ADRs and memory first. Settled decisions are not relitigated silently |
| 2 | Write an ADR: Status · Context · Decision · Consequences · **Alternatives Rejected** · **Verification** |
| 3 | Name the gate criterion that verifies it. A decision with no test is a preference |
| 4 | **Efe's explicit approval** before the ADR is Accepted |
| 5 | Implement the gate that enforces it |
| 6 | Add a planted violation to `ci/self_test.sh` |
| 7 | Recompute the architecture checksum; bump the architecture version |

**Commits use the `[LIONEL-CORE]` prefix. No autonomous commit or push — ever.**

---

## 6. ADR modification policy

**ADRs are immutable once Accepted.** Three permitted operations:

| Operation | Mechanism | Precedent |
|---|---|---|
| **Supersede** | New ADR; original's `Status` line updated with a forward link. Original text untouched | ADR-0004 → ADR-0010 |
| **Amend** | Dated `## Amendment` section appended. Adds scope without contradicting | ADR-0013 ×2, ADR-0017 |
| **Erratum** | Dated `## Erratum` section correcting text to state a decision **already in force**. Original wording quoted verbatim. **No policy change** | ADR-0013, 2026-08-02 |

Forbidden: editing an Accepted ADR's Decision in place without an Erratum; deleting an ADR;
renumbering.

> **Open governance gap, recorded not fixed:** ADR-0016 has no erratum provision, while
> practice has diverged from it three times. Closing it requires an ADR and is a Phase 1
> item.

---

## 7. Phase 1 entry criteria

Phase 1 may begin when **all** hold:

| # | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Architecture frozen at a named commit SHA | ✅ `0066cb2`, tag `architecture-1.0.0` |
| 2 | Clean clone of that commit scores 17/17 gates | ✅ verified 2026-08-10 |
| 3 | `artifacts.lock.yaml` — 0 unresolved, in the frozen commit | ✅ 13 resolved / 0 unresolved |
| 4 | Capability registry governance fields, in the frozen commit | ✅ 5 of 5 capabilities |
| 5 | Architecture checksum recorded against the commit SHA | ✅ reproducible — `scripts/architecture_checksum.py` |
| 6 | ADR count 28, no contradictions | ✅ |
| 7 | Contract set 1.1.0, all schemas valid, examples validate | ✅ |
| 8 | Trust model consistent across contracts and registry | ✅ |
| 9 | CI enforces the architecture — 17 gates wired | ✅ |
| 10 | Security assumptions documented | ✅ |
| 11 | Ownership defined for contracts and capabilities | ✅ |
| 12 | No circular dependencies | ✅ |

**12 of 12 met.** Phase 1 may begin.

## 8. Freeze execution

Performed 2026-08-10.

### 8.1 What was executed

| Step | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 · Commit the architecture | `0066cb2` — 12 paths, exactly the set the audit enumerated |
| 2 · Push | `origin/main`, [run 31368070033](https://github.com/Denizfe/L.I.O.N.E.L/actions/runs/31368070033) green |
| 3 · Clean-clone, all gates | **17 / 17**, `0` broken |
| 4 · Clean-clone, self-test | **10 / 10** planted violations caught |
| 5 · Recompute the checksum | `sha256:fab0610a…` — **matches**, all five group digests |
| 6 · Tag | `architecture-1.0.0` |
| 7 · Re-submit the sign-off | `Phase0_Final_Signoff.md` §15 — verdict **PASS** |

Only the twelve paths the audit listed went into `0066cb2`. Nothing found afterwards was
folded back into it: a freeze commit that quietly grew is a freeze of something nobody
audited.

### 8.2 Reproducing the freeze

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denizfe/L.I.O.N.E.L.git && cd L.I.O.N.E.L
git checkout architecture-1.0.0
pip install pyyaml jsonschema grpcio-tools
bash ci/run_gates.sh          # expect 17/17, 0 broken
bash ci/self_test.sh          # expect 10/10
python3 scripts/architecture_checksum.py --verify sha256:fab0610aa3167a2f26b0e812dbfe9563abbf7aa28ab18b9d773d945a5a84f233
```

`grpcio-tools` is required: without it the `protobuf` gate exits 2, which is a broken gate,
not a passing repository, and the runner reports it as such.

### 8.3 Why the tag is not on `0066cb2`

Verifying the freeze surfaced three defects in the tooling around it. None touched the
architecture — the checksum is byte-identical across all of them — but two had to be fixed
before the freeze could mean what it claims.

| Commit | Fix | Why it blocks the freeze |
|---|---|---|
| `b2e0b94` | `*.proto text eol=lf` | Without it a Windows clone computes a **different** architecture checksum. §7 criterion 5 is then unmeetable: the recorded checksum is not a property of the commit |
| `b2e0b94` | UTF-8 stdout in `ci/gates/_lib.py` | Every gate died with `UnicodeEncodeError` on a cp1252 console, reporting "broken gate" on a clean repository. §7 criterion 2 unverifiable on the platform this project targets |
| `b2e0b94` | `scripts/architecture_checksum.py` | A checksum nobody can recompute cannot detect drift, so §2 asserted something unfalsifiable |
| `968eace` | Regenerated `CI_Inventory.md`, `Policy_Gates.md` | Findings N1/N2. Documentation only |

All four are permitted by §4 without an ADR: items 3 and 4 — gate work that enforces an
existing decision more completely, and regenerating generated documents.

So `0066cb2` is where the architecture entered version control, and `architecture-1.0.0` is
the commit you should clone: the first one where the freeze's own criteria are all
demonstrably met.

### 8.4 Rule count: 116 → 127

§3 previously recorded 116 rules, an audit estimate taken from `g.fail(...)` call sites.
That undercounts, because `l0-conformance` emits 24 distinct rules through a **single**
`g.fail(rid, …)` driven by an invariant table. Counting distinct emittable rule IDs gives
**127**, now derived mechanically by `scripts/generate_ci_docs.py`. The gates did not
change; the count was wrong. Recorded here rather than silently corrected, per §6.
